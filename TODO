 --- Before adding PPA ask if its not presented already.
 --- In case we want install already installed application ask for reinstallation.
 --- For logging in subscripts we have to pass logging file to them as an argument - to be able to use $SUDO_USER
     and not hard coded name. Since sub scripts are ran from main script which is sudo itself, $SUDO_USER in subscripts
     is always "ROOT".
